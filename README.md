My submission for the Unity Developer position at Metaverse Development.

Controls:  

- Moving around: WASD
- Open Text Panel: "~"
- Quit Application: "Escape"

Which scene to open:

The scene to open is in the folder "ArdaBerkInan" and the scene name is "ArdaBerkInan_Scene".

Build:

I made a build for PC and have also provided the link for the PC build has well. 

Summary:

I used Inworld AI to integrate an NPC. I made changes to existing scripts to fit the 
requirements of the task. There are some issues such as when trying to quit, the application 
will not quit correctly and the AI will have trouble connecting at times so you will have to 
restart the application. Due to the time constraint and having a full-time job, I did not have 
enough time to look more into this. I learned a lot from working on this task and 
hopefully it satisfies all requirements.
